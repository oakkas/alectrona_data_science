1. Let's create a person class which has name, age, gender attributes.
2. Using above person class, create a student class. It has all the attributes from person,
  and courses, schedule attributes. Student takes and drop courses, study, take exam. When asked student can display his/her schedule. 
3. Create a course class with attributes description, credit and course_schedule, exam_schedule, instructor. One should be able to display course schedule and other info seperatelly. 
4. Create an instructor class from Person. In addition to attributes from person, it has courses, schedule, rating attributes. Instructor can open a new course. When asked instructor can display his/her schedule.
